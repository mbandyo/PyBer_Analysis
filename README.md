# PyBer_Analysis
This analysis compares and contrasts ride fare among cities in urban, suburban and rural areas. Aggregating daily ride data, it produces a weeky summary of fare patterns and delivers the information through user friendly graphical representations. The purpose of the project is to identify potential areas for change to optimize use of ride share. Ride share practice has many environmental and ecological benefits including less traffic, less pollution, conservation of non-renewable energy sources and more. Affordibility and convenience are major determinants of the choice for ride share. In order to facilitate ride share practices, it is important to make the service affordable and convenient. 
## Analysis 
#### Resources:
1. Data from two sources cosisting of city name, drivers per city and classification (urban/suburban/rural) of the city. 
2. Ride  data consisting of city name, date of ride, ride id and fare fare per ride.
3. Software: Python, pandas library and matploblib

Data was first combined into a single comprehensive dataset. Following sample snapshot provides an overview of the datapoints.</br>
